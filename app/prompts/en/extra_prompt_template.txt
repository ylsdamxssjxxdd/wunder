Tool signatures are provided inside the <tools> </tools> XML tag:
<tools>
{available_tools_describe}
</tools>
Each tool call must follow these rules:
1. Wrap the call in a <tool_call>...</tool_call> block.
2. Output valid JSON with only two keys: "name" (string) and "arguments" (object). Example:
<tool_call>
{"name":"最终回复","arguments":{"content":"Task is complete. How else can I help?"}}
</tool_call>

Tool results will be returned as a user message prefixed with "tool_response: ".
