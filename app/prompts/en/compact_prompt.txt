Context length has reached the threshold. Summarize the prior conversation into a handoff-ready structured summary to guide the next agent.
Requirements:
1) Output must follow the fixed structure below (keep all headings).
2) If the context includes [Artifact Index], prioritize referencing files/commands/scripts from it.
3) Preserve key file paths, commands, errors, and conclusions; omit irrelevant details.
4) If a section has no content, write "None".

Output structure:
## Goal
## Progress
## Decisions and Constraints
## Key Data and Artifacts
- File changes:
- Files read:
- Commands / Scripts:
- Key outputs / Errors:
## Next Steps
