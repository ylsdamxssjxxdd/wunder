# wunder Narrative Outline

This outline is for explaining wunder to teammates who have only used chat-based LLMs. It emphasizes the end-to-end story from question to delivery, aligned with the `docs/ppt` slide structure and production requirements.

## 1. Core storyline
- Main thread: move from “asking” to “delivery”, turning chat into executable results and reusable assets.
- Keywords: Core Idea → Tool System → Workspace → Frontier Features (memory/compaction, A2UI, A2A) → Agent Session Management → Quick Start.

## 2. Section flow (aligned with the PPT)
### 01 Core Idea: from chatting to getting things done
- What to say: for developers everything is an interface, for the model everything is a tool; `/wunder` is the unified entry with streaming progress and orchestration.
- What to remember: wunder is not a chat tool, it is an “executable pipeline”.
- Bridge: start with the principle—question to delivery.

### 02 Tool System: once the mechanism is in place, capabilities become six tool types
- What to say: Built-in / MCP / Skills / Knowledge / Custom / Shared, unified by “what it is / why it matters / governance”.
- What to remember: capabilities become governable and reusable after toolization.
- Bridge: the idea lands into tools and becomes controllable.

### 03 Workspace: tool execution needs a long-term home
- What to say: persistent workspace per user, files and artifacts accumulate and can be reused.
- What to remember: output is not just text—it is deliverable assets.
- Bridge: to deliver, you need a durable place to store and reuse.
- Demo slide: show “Python draws a heart → save to temp workspace → download” to prove the tools + workspace loop.

### 04 Frontier features: memory & compaction / A2UI / A2A
- What to say: memory + compaction keep long chats stable; A2UI turns outputs into renderable UI; A2A standardizes external access.
- What to remember: frontier features make the system sustainable, presentable, and interoperable.
- Bridge: once the foundations are stable, add memory, UI, and outward standardization.

### 05 Agent session management: as tasks go concurrent, monitoring keeps it stable
- What to say: lifecycle, monitoring events, cancellation.
- What to remember: the process is observable, accountable, and controllable.
- Bridge: when tasks run in parallel, session management ensures stability.

### 06 Quick start: bring capability back to real business scenarios
- What to say: pick a scenario, pick tools, standardize the workflow.
- What to remember: start with a high-frequency need and see results fast.
- Bridge: anchor capability in real scenarios to build a sustained loop.

## 3. One-line closing
- wunder turns LLMs from “chatting” into “doing”, with long-term stable reuse.

## 4. PPT production requirements
- Global: light theme, 16:9 safe area, no overflow, pure HTML + JS, no speaker notes; each point must be a dedicated slide; except cover and TOC, every slide must show “Section X” and progress. Use bridge sentences to connect sections without saying “next section”.
- Cover: only a big title plus one subtitle/slogan.
- TOC: fixed order: Core Idea / Tool System / Workspace / Frontier Features / Agent Session Management / Quick Start.
- Core Idea: one slide only, highlight “/wunder unified entry, SSE progress, orchestration + tool execution chain”.
- Tool System: one overview slide, then six category slides; each category uses “what it is / why it matters / governance”.
- Built-in tools: cover file read/write/search/replace, command exec, ptc; emphasize allow_paths / allow_commands.
- MCP tools: explain server@tool, external system integration, allow_tools allowlist, and unified timeouts.
- Skills tools: highlight SKILL.md + run.py, SOP codification, one-line trigger.
- Knowledge tools: Markdown repo, heading split, query/limit inputs, rerank, traceable answers.
- Custom tools: path `data/user_tools/<user_id>`, isolated, personal, optionally shared.
- Shared tools: share catalog/config only, not workspace; name `owner_id@tool`, explicit enablement.
- Workspace: path, persistent assets, tool integration; stress “reusable outputs”.
- Agent demo: draw a heart in Python, save to temp workspace, download; prove tools + workspace loop.
- Frontier features: three slides in order: “Memory & Compaction / A2UI / A2A”, all labeled “Section 4 Frontier Features”.
- Memory & compaction: thresholds, structured summary injection, auto continuity; emphasize “context occupancy tokens” not total consumption.
- Long-term memory: generation timing, record limit, injection method, toggle control.
- A2UI: model outputs A2UI JSON, SSE events, front-end rendering; stress “answers become UI”.
- A2A: JSON-RPC + SSE, AgentCard discovery, unified auth; stress cross-system interoperability.
- Session management: lifecycle and concurrency rules; observable, cancellable, conflict responses.
- Quick start: three steps (pick scenario / pick tool combo / codify workflow), include pilot examples.
- Closing: thank you + closing slogan + Q&A prompt.
